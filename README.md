# drugkinase
A convolutional neural network that predicts the binding affinity of drugs with certain protein kinases
In this project, I use data about the interactions between proteins and compounds to predict the IC50 value given any drug and protein. The directory does not contain the databases I created because they are too large for github. You will find all of my code that I used throughout this project here.
